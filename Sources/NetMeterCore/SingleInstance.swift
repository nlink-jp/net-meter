/// LaunchServices resolves the bundle identifier among *all* registered copies
/// (dev build in `dist/`, a release-verification extraction, `/Applications`)
/// and may pick a different copy than the running one. Two copies would stack
/// two menu bar items and sample the counters twice.

/// guard; this decision covers the launch paths LS does not see (direct binary
/// exec, `open -n`).
